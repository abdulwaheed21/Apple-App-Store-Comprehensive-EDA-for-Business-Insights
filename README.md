## Key Insights

- **Games** dominate the app store but are highly competitive, while genres like **Business** and **Education** offer opportunities for growth with moderate competition.
- Free apps are more common than paid apps across most genres, with some categories relying heavily on the freemium model.
- Higher-priced apps tend to be in categories like **Productivity**, but price doesn't strongly correlate with app size.
- Apps targeting younger audiences (e.g., rated 4+ or 9+) are common, making these age groups significant to target for future app development.
